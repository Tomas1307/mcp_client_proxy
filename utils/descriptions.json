  "github": "GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git, the distributed version control system, serving as a central hub for collaborative software development and project management. Its primary purpose is to facilitate efficient code versioning, sharing, and collaboration among developers, enabling teams to work concurrently on projects regardless of their geographical location.GitHub is indispensable for various key use cases, including robust version control, allowing developers to track changes, revert to previous states ('get_commit', 'list_commits'), and manage different code versions through branching ('create_branch', 'list_branches', 'update_pull_request_branch'). It's also a cornerstone for team collaboration, enabling multiple contributors to work on the same codebase, review each other's work ('create_pull_request_review', 'get_pull_request_reviews', 'add_pull_request_review_comment'), and merge changes ('merge_pull_request'). For comprehensive software project management, GitHub provides tools for task tracking, bug reporting, and feature development through issues ('create_issue', 'get_issue', 'list_issues', 'update_issue', 'add_issue_comment', 'search_issues').Beyond these core capabilities, GitHub offers a rich set of functionalities. Developers can initiate new projects by creating repositories ('create_repository') or contributing to existing ones by forking repositories ('fork_repository'). Code changes are managed through pull requests ('create_pull_request', 'get_pull_request', 'list_pull_requests', 'update_pull_request'), where collaborators can discuss and review proposed modifications ('get_pull_request_comments', 'get_pull_request_files', 'get_pull_request_status'). Files can be directly manipulated ('create_or_update_file', 'get_file_contents', 'push_files'). For security, GitHub integrates tools to 'get_code_scanning_alert', 'list_code_scanning_alerts', 'get_secret_scanning_alert', and 'list_secret_scanning_alerts', helping identify vulnerabilities. The platform also facilitates broad searches across its vast codebase ('search_code', 'search_repositories', 'search_users') and allows users to manage their own profiles ('get_me').",
  "brave-search": "Brave Search is a privacy-preserving search engine that operates independently, built on its own index rather than relying on external sources. Its primary purpose is to provide users with relevant search results while prioritizing their privacy, ensuring no tracking, profiling, or intrusive ads. This commitment to privacy sets it apart as a user-centric search alternative.Brave Search proves indispensable in scenarios where data privacy is paramount, such as when conducting sensitive research, seeking unbiased information without personalized filtering, or for individuals who simply prefer a search experience free from the pervasive data collection of traditional engines. It's an ideal choice for users who wish to minimize their digital footprint and maintain control over their personal information online.The core capabilities of Brave Search are anchored in its privacy-first philosophy and its independent indexing system. Users can leverage the 'brave_web_search' functionality to perform comprehensive searches across the internet, retrieving a wide array of information. Additionally, the 'brave_local_search' feature enables geographically targeted queries, allowing users to find information relevant to specific locations, such as businesses, services, or events in their vicinity. These functionalities are designed to work seamlessly, delivering a complete and private search experience that empowers users to access information on their terms, without compromising their data.",
  "google-maps": "Google Maps is a comprehensive web mapping service developed by Google, providing detailed geographical information, satellite imagery, aerial photography, street maps, 360Â° panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle, air (in beta), or public transportation. Its primary purpose is to help users navigate the world, discover locations, and plan their journeys efficiently.\n\nGoogle Maps is indispensable in various key use cases, including everyday navigation for commuters and travelers, enabling efficient route planning ('maps_directions') and real-time traffic updates. It's crucial for discovering points of interest, businesses, and amenities, assisting users in finding specific places or exploring new areas ('maps_search_places'). For businesses, it serves as a vital tool for showcasing their location and reaching customers, while individuals leverage it for personal trip planning, finding nearby services, and understanding geographical contexts. It's also invaluable for geotagging and location-based services.\n\nGoogle Maps offers a rich set of functionalities that empower its diverse uses. Users can convert addresses to geographical coordinates and vice-versa through 'maps_geocode' and 'maps_reverse_geocode' respectively. Detailed information about specific locations, including contact details, reviews, and operating hours, can be retrieved using 'maps_place_details'. For logistical planning, 'maps_distance_matrix' calculates travel times and distances between multiple origins and destinations. Users can also determine the elevation of specific points on the Earth's surface using 'maps_elevation'. All these tools integrate seamlessly to provide a robust and intuitive mapping and navigation experience."
